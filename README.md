# Satisfactory Planner - Elixir Edition

First small elixir project to get a feeling for the language.  
Don't know what Satisfactory is: https://www.satisfactorygame.com/

## Current Featurelist (rich as hell):

\* Enter a resource and the desired quanity and get a list of resources you need to build them

## Run it yourself

- Install Elixir: https://elixir-lang.org/install.html
- cd into project directory

```elixir
iex -S mix
iex> Calculator.run

(z.B. Eisenplatten 10):> VerstaerkteEisenplatten 15
```
